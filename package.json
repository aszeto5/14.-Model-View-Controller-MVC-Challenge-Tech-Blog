  "description": "## Description Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, <br/> but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A <br/> simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!  Your<br/> challenge this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other <br/> developers’ posts as well. You’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its <br/> architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.",
