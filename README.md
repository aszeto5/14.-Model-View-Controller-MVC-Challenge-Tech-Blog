# 14.-Model-View-Controller-MVC-Challenge-Tech-Blog

## Description
Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, <br/>
but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A <br/>
simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!  Your<br/>
challenge this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other <br/>
developers’ posts as well. You’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its <br/>
architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
